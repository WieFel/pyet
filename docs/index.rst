*pyet* - Estimation of Potential Evapotranspiration
===================================================

Pyet is an open source Python package for the estimation of reference and potential evapotranspiration (PET) from
time series data (`Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_) and gridded data (`Xarray <https://xarray.dev>`_). This
allows users to estimate potential evapotranspiration and calibrate the models with just a few lines of python code.
