==========

PyET is built on a lot of scientific literature on the estimation of potential evapotranspiration. Here the
references are listed for all the methods implemented in PyET, and the references used to benchmark the methods. This
list is automatically generated from a public Zotero library every so many months. For a list of publications using
PyET we refer to the `Publications` page of this website.

TEST: Can I now reference something  :cite:p:`haude_determination_1955`.
