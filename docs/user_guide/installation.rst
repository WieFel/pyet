includes most of the python package dependencies and the Jupyter Lab
software to run the notebooks. Moreover, it includes the Graphical User
Interface (GUI) Spyder to start scripting in Python. However, you are free
to install any Python distribution you want.

The latest stable version of the *pyet* package is available from the Pypi

To install in developer mode, clone the GitHub repository and use the
following syntax:

>>> pip install -e .
